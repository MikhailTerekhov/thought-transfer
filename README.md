# Cross-mapping residual streams in language models
## Installation
Code for my MATS 2024 application. It was run using EPFL's clusters. For instructions to build the container, see [here](installation/docker-amd64-cuda). The code uses minimal requirements, the only nontrivial one is TransformerLens, which can be installed via
```
pip install git+https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens
```
## Results
